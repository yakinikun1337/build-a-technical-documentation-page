            <p>Cryptocurrencies, a form of digital or virtual currency, are growing in popularity as an alternative to traditional, government-issued money.</p>
            <p>This section introduces cryptocurrencies and discusses their significance in today's financial landscape.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cryptocurrencies use <code>cryptography</code> for secure transactions.</li>
                <li>They are not controlled by any central authority, making them <code>decentralized</code>.</li>
                <li>Bitcoin, created in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency and remains the most commonly traded.</li>
            </ul>

<section class="main-section" id="Blockchain_Technology">
    <header>Blockchain Technology</header>
            <p>Blockchain technology is the foundation of cryptocurrency. It's a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, in several databases, known as the "chain," in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes.</p>
            <p>This storage is referred to as a 'digital ledger.'</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner.</li>
                <li>Blockchain is known for its <code>highly secure</code> design, its decentralization, and its immutability.</li>
                <li>Blocks are linked together with a hash function, creating a chain that ensures the security of the entire system.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Mining">
    <header>Mining</header>
            <p>Mining involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain network and adding them to the ledger. It requires significant computational power and sophisticated equipment.</p>
            <p>Miners solve complex mathematical problems, and in return, they get rewarded with newly minted coins.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mining adds new blocks to the blockchain in a process that requires solving complex <code>cryptographic puzzles</code>.</li>
                <li>As compensation for their efforts, miners receive cryptocurrency as a reward.</li>
                <li>The process of mining is what allows cryptocurrencies to function as a <code>decentralized peer-to-peer network</code>, without the need for a third-party central authority.</li>
            </ul>

    <header>Wallets</header>
            <p>Cryptocurrency wallets are digital tools that allow you to store and manage your blockchain assets and cryptocurrencies.</p>
            <p>There are various types of wallets catering to different needs and varying in terms of security, ease of use, and accessibility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Software wallets</code> are apps or programs that allow you to send, receive, and manage your cryptocurrency.</li>
                <li><code>Hardware wallets</code> are physical devices that store your cryptocurrency offline, offering an extra layer of security against online attacks.</li>
                <li><code>Paper wallets</code> are physical documents that contain your cryptocurrency addresses and private keys.</li>
            </ul>

    <header>Cryptocurrency Trading</header>
            <p>Cryptocurrency trading involves speculating on price movements via a CFD trading account or buying and selling the underlying coins via an exchange.</p>
            <p>Trading can be highly volatile, offering plenty of opportunities, but also involving significant risk.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Exchanges</code> provide platforms for trading cryptocurrencies for other assets, including digital and fiat currencies.</li>
                <li>Traders can use various strategies such as <code>swing trading</code>, <code>day trading</code>, or <code>HODLing</code> (holding on for dear life).</li>
                <li>Understanding and analyzing the market is crucial for successful trading.</li>
